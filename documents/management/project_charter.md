# 2024 - 2025 Project-1 FPGA Team-2 - Project Charter

## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to re-create the video game *Frogger* on an FPGA platform. This involves implementing key mechanics such as player movement, obstacle interaction, scoring, and game-over functionality. The client for this project is ALGOSUP, a development school based in Vierzon, France.

## Scope
This project must be developed using the Verilog language and deployed on an FPGA board. The main features will focus on game interactions like movements, collisions, and obstacles rather than the visual design.

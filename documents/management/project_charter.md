# 2024 - 2025 Project-1 FPGA Team-2 - Project Charter

## Project goal
The main goal for this project is to re-create the video games named FROGGER on FPGA platfrom. This involves to implementing some mechanics sush as, player movements, obstacles interraction, scoring, game-over functionality. The client for this project is ALGOSUP, a developing school based in Vierzon in France.  

## Scope
This project have to be in Verilog language and using an FPGA board. The main features need to be foculized on the game interaction like movements, collisions, obstacles than the desing.

# Weekly Report of Team 2
### Weekly Report - Week of November 23, 2024

1. **Introduction:**  
- This week marked the official kick-off for our new project, which was introduced to us on Monday, November 23, by Franck. The objective of this project is to create a classic game—Frogger—using FPGA hardware. We began with a scrum meeting to break down the scope of the project and assign roles to each team member.

2. **Accomplishments:**  
- Our program manager started to fill the functional specification document.  
- The production and design of the game already began.  
- The software engineers are currently training themselves in learning this new language.  
- The quality assurance team worked on the test plan template for better organization of tests and reports.

3. **Challenges:**  
- Making the new students understand their roles and what they need to achieve.

4. **Plans for Next Week:**  
- Complete the functional specification.  
- Start the technical specification.  
- Start the KPI's implementation.

5. **Conclusion:**  
- This first week was crucial in setting the groundwork for the Frogger game project. We have successfully started drafting key documents such as the functional specification, initiated the design process, and provided the team with the necessary training. While there were challenges in onboarding new team members and clarifying their roles, we are making progress towards aligning everyone with the project goals. Next week, we aim to finalize our functional specifications and begin working on the technical aspects. Overall, the week was productive, with positive steps toward establishing a strong foundation for the project's success.

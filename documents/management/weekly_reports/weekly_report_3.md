### Weekly Report - Week of October 7, 2024

1. **Introduction:**  
- At the beginning of the week, I decided to make a global point on the advancement of the project with every team member and also held one-on-one meetings to see how they perceive the ambiance in the group and identify any changes or upgrades needed to boost their motivation. 

2. **Accomplishments:**  
- The first test cases appeared.
- Technical specifications have been finished.
- The next features have been implemented:
    - Collisions
    - Scoring 

3. **Challenges:**  
- The current code takes too much memory for the board (currently, 3 cars are the maximum allowed on the board).
- Need to remove some initial sprites to save memory.

4. **Plans for Next Week:**  
- Refactor the code to optimize it.
- Finish the user manual.
- Allocate maximum resources to the development part.

5. **Conclusion:**  
- This week, we made significant progress by completing the technical specifications and implementing key features like collisions and scoring. However, we faced challenges with memory optimization, which will be our primary focus for the next week. We aim to refactor the code and finish the user manual to ensure smooth progress in the upcoming weeks.

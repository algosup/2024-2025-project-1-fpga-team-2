## KPI's
In this section, we present the completion of the KPIs and how the calculations have been performed:

### Completion Calculation of Files & Review
For each document structured with three main sections "# Main Point" for the main sections (referred to as "Main Points"), each containing a different number of sub-sections ("Subpoints"). These sub-sections are represented in markdown by the headings "## Sub-Title" for the sub-sections.

#### Structure Overview
- **Main Point 1**: 10 Subpoints
- **Main Point 2**: 7 Subpoints
- **Main Point 3**: 12 Subpoints

**Total Subpoints**: 29

#### Completion Status
The table below outlines the number of subpoints completed for each main point.
| Main Point    | Completed Subpoints | Total Subpoints |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Main Point 1  | 6                   | 10              |
| Main Point 2  | 7                   | 7               |
| Main Point 3  | 4                   | 12              |

#### Total Completion Calculation
1. **Total Completed**: 
  6 + 7 + 4 = 17

2. **Total Possible**: 
  10 + 7 + 12 = 29


### Files

##### Total Percentage Calculation
$$
\text{Total Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Completed}}{\text{Total Possible}} \right) \times 100
$$

### Review

##### Total Percentage Calculation
$$
\text{Total Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Completed}}{\text{Total Possible}} \right) \times 100
$$

### Design

## KPI's
In this section, we present the completion of the KPIs and how the calculations have been performed:

### Completion Calculation
#### Files & Review
For each document structured with three main sections "# Main Point" for the main sections (referred to as "Main Points"), each containing a different number of sub-sections ("Subpoints"). These sub-sections are represented in markdown by the headings "## Sub-Title" for the sub-sections.

##### Structure Overview
- **Main Point 1**: 10 Subpoints
- **Main Point 2**: 7 Subpoints
- **Main Point 3**: 12 Subpoints

**Total Subpoints**: 29

##### Completion Status
The table below outlines the number of subpoints completed for each main point.
| Main Point    | Completed Subpoints | Total Subpoints |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Main Point 1  | 6                   | 10              |
| Main Point 2  | 7                   | 7               |
| Main Point 3  | 4                   | 12              |

##### Total Completion Calculation
**Total Completed**: 
  6 + 7 + 4 = 17

**Total Possible**: 
  10 + 7 + 12 = 29

#### Desing & Bonus
Each tasks are seperated on multiples point for example the task "Frog Movement" is seperated in five parts:
- Up
- Right
- Down
- Left
- If button still pressed continue to move

##### Total Completion Calculation
**Total Completed**: 
  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4

**Total Possible**: 
  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

#### Calculation
$$
\text{Total Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Completed}}{\text{Total Possible}} \right) \times 100
$$

### Team Mood
The mood of the team's members is also verified to ensure that nobody is left behind. Each team member responds to a survey each week, which includes 3 questions. Each question can be rated from 0 to 10. There are 7 people in the team.

#### Calculation
The total possible score for each week is calculated as follows:
$$
\text{Total Possible Score} = \text{Number of Questions} \times \text{Maximum Score per Question} \times \text{Number of Team Members}
$$
$$
\text{Total Possible Score} = 3 \times 10 \times 7 = 210
$$
$$
\text{Team Mood Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Achieved Score}}{\text{Total Possible Score}} \right) \times 100
$$

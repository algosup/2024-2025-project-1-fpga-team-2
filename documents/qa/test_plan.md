## 1. Introduction

The aim of this project is to, using the Verilog[^1] language, re-create a classic game named Frogger. It's an arcade game where reach each waterlilies (5 in total) is the goal. For doing that, the frog needs to avoid some cars on the roads and crosses a river climbing on logs or turtles shells. Since is a re-creation, some sprites have changed like the frog, now a raccoon, cars which are now garbage trucks and waterlilies that are henceforth trash cans.

## 2. Document purpose

The aim of this document is to report what will be tested on the game, both on the hardware[^2] side and the software[^3] side. To do that, all the tests will be carried out by manual testing.

More precisely, this document and the test cases will gather some information like:
- Check if the game works correctly or not.
- Ensure that the product meets the software[^3] requirements.
- Identify the presence of bugs or other problems.
- Check the code's and game's security to avoid issues on the customer's hardware[^2].
- Verify the responsiveness of the product

## 3. Tests metrics

To know which bugs need to be fixed as soon as possible and which bugs aren't very important, they will be ranked on a scale from "Low" to "High".

### 3.1 In-Scope/Out-scope
<br>

**In-scope:**
- Main functionalities
- No bugs or any kind of issues which could impact the gameplay
- Responsive and usable switches without latency
- A consistency between the current level (not round) and the number displays on the 7-segments screen
- Sprites which show correctly
- A playable sprite that moves according to the switches pushed

**Out-scope:**
- Sprites' colors
- Any futures updates or improvements (indicated in the [Functional Specification](../functional/functional_specifications.md))

### 3.2 Pass/Fail Criteria

In order to know if the tests succeed, this is important to establish some information like the acceptance criteria.
Since in this kind of game, the success of tests cannot be expressed as a mark or a percentage:
- A test is concluded as successful when the expected results are the same as what really happened.
- Conversely, a test is considered as failed when the things happened isn't according to the expected results.

## 4. Test goals

It's very important to correctly defined the tests for an understanding approach. Indeed, bugs, issues or anything else can be very well hidden in the code. In order to prevent these problems, each component will be tested individually and collectively with a particularly attention on the performance, verifying that previous features will not be impacted when implementing changes to the code.
You will find all the tests which will be carried out below.

### 4.1. Tests' definition

- **Unit test**

  - A unit test is a testing method where the units or components are checked individually to verify that all the features of a product work separately.
  
  <br><u>How does it work?</u>
  1. Write tests for individual components
  2. Do the tests
  3. Point any issues or problems
  4. Resolve any troubles and retest components
  5. Document test results
  6. Repeat the process until all components pass unit testing
<br>

- **System test**

  - A system test is another testing method quite different from the unit test. Indeed, this kind of test is "global" in order, this time, to check if all the functionalities operate together.

  <br><u>How does it work? *(a little bit different)*</u>
  1. Write tests for the game
  2. Observe the tests 
  3. Point any issues or problems
  4. Resolve any troubles and re-observe the test
  5. Document test results
  6. Repeat the process until the game pass system testing
<br>

- **Regression test**

  - A regression test is ensuring that the previously working functionalities remain intact after changes.

  <br><u>How does it work?</u>
  1. Write tests for the game
  2. Observe if new features don't impact the oldest ones
  3. Point any issues or problems
  4. Resolve any troubles and re-observe the tests
  5. Document test results
  6. Repeat the process until the game pass regression testing
<br>

- **Performance test**

  - A performance test measures the systemâ€™s performance under different conditions, such as load testing.

  <br><u>How does it works?</u>
  1. Write tests for the game
  2. Observe if the game doesn't make too time to respond to our command
  3. Point any issues or problems
  4. Resolve any latency between our action and the game
  5. Document test results
  6. Repeat the process until the game pass performance tests
<br>

### 4.3. Tests' functioning

Here is the flowchart of how the bugs were reported (and document) to the software engineer.
![Tests'Flowchart](../images/qa/flowchart.png)

There are 2 cases:
- Either there are no bugs and "Yes" is written in the test case success column
- Or there is a bug, and in this case, the tests results are documented, the developers are warned and they fix the bug so that the qa can retest

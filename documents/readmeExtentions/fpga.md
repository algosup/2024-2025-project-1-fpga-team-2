# FPGA
*Model used (Lattice ICE40 HX1K)*

An **FPGA** *(Field-Programmable Gate Array)* is a type of integrated circuit that can be configured or "programmed" by the user after manufacturing. Unlike traditional processors, which run software, FPGAs allow you to define custom hardware logic directly. They consist of a grid of logic blocks and programmable interconnections, enabling the creation of specific circuits and functionalities tailored to particular tasks.

### Why is it interesting to learn how FPGAs work? <br>
- Customization: You can create specialized hardware for high-performance applications (like signal processing or cryptography) optimized for specific tasks.

- Parallelism: FPGAs can execute many operations in parallel, offering significant speed advantages over CPUs for certain types of computations.

- Real-time processing: Their ability to handle real-time tasks makes them essential in fields like aerospace, telecommunications, and automotive systems.

- Low power usage: FPGAs can be designed to be power-efficient, which is critical in embedded systems or battery-powered devices.

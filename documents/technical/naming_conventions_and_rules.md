(e.g : naming_conventions)

## Rules.

### Comments

```Verilog
//This Program is an exemple for the rules by Matt√©o Lefin 

    module example_project(
        input i_Clk, // Initialize a go_board's clock
        input i_Switch_1, // Initialize the first button on the go_board
        output o_LED_1 // Initialize the first LED on the go_board
     );
    reg prev_switch; // This register has for purpose to keep the previous state of the button

    // This part of the code will turn on/off a LED and keep it on/off using a switch
    always @(posedge i_Clk)
    begin
        if(i_Switch_1 && prev_switch)
        begin
            o_LED_1 = ~r_LED_1; 
        end
        prev_switch <= o_LED_1;
    end


    endmodule

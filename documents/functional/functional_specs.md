## **1. Introduction**

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional specifications for the recreation of the classic *Frogger* game. It details all the functionalities, features, and interactions that the game will encompass. This document aims to answer every potential "what" question regarding the game design and structure.

<br>
<br>

## **2. Game Overview**

**What is Frogger?**

Frogger is an arcade-style game where the player controls a frog that must make its way across a busy road and river to reach the other side safely. The objective is to avoid obstacles and reach the goal within a certain time.

**What is the main goal of the game?**

The goal of the game is to guide the frog from the bottom of the screen to a safe destination at the top, avoiding obstacles such as cars, trucks, and hazards in the river, and reaching the final "home" spaces.

**What are the visuals of the original version?**

For comparison purposes, let's introduce the original game desgins :

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="./4docs/frogger_map.jpg">

**Description of the map and mecanics (from bottom to top):**

- The first purple zone is the starting zone, nothing can harm the frog here.

- The road is crossed horizontaly by multiple obstacles (from left to right or inversly). If the frog hit an obstacle, a life is lost.

- The second purple zone is a safe zone, nothing can harm the frog here one again. It serves as transition from road to river.

- In the river, it is the opposite mechanic. The frog need to use the turtules shells and logs to cross the river. Some of the shells temporarily disappear. If the frog fall in the water, a life is lost. 

- The last has the water lilys that serves as checkpoints. The frog must land on each of them to complet the whole level. If landed on the cactus, a life is lost.


**What we decided to change compared to the original game?**

The player will now play a little raccoon, and all the basic concepts of the frogger, will be translated to fit with the raccoon. 

<br>
<br>

## **3. Game Mechanics**

### **3.1 Movement and Controls**

**What controls are available to the player?**

- Players can move the raccoon up, down, left, or right using the switches of the board.

**What happens when the player moves the frog?**

- The raccoon moves one step in the chosen direction, and if the switch is maintained, the raccoon will pursue his way in the choosen direction until the switch is released.

**What restrictions are there on movement?**

- The raccoon cannot move off the screen.
- Movement are restricted based on obstacles such as traffic, water, and boundaries.
- The raccoon cannot move in other ways than that : top, bottom, right and left.

<br>

### **3.2 Obstacles and Hazards**

**What types of obstacles are there?**

1. **Traffic:**
    - Cars, garbage trucks, and school buses move horizontally across the screen in predefined lanes.
2. <span style="color: grey"><s>**River Hazards:**
    - <s>Water is an instant hazard where the frog will drown unless standing on a floating object, as logs and trurtules.</s>
    - <s>Logs and turtles float on the river, allowing safe passage if timed correctly.</s></span>

**What happens when the frog encounters an obstacle?**

- If the frog touches a vehicle the player loses a life, and the frog returns to the start of the level (5 rounds).

<br>

### **3.3 Timer and Score**

**What is the purpose of the timer?**

- Each level has a time limit (60 seconds), requiring the player to move quickly to complete the level.

**What scoring system is implemented?**

- Points are awarded for successfully completing a level.

<br>

### **3.4 Winning and Losing Conditions**

**What are the win conditions?**

- The player wins the level when all frogs safely reach the designated "home" spots at the top of the screen. Those 5 "homes" are represented by trashes. To complete a level, the player has to reach the five trashes.

**What are the losing conditions?**

- The player loses a life if they:
    - Get hit by a vehicle.
    - <span style="color: grey">Fall into the river.</span>
    - Run out of time.
    - Land in a non-home space at the top of the screen (the worksite barriers).
- The game is over when the 5 lives are lost.

<br>
<br>

## **4. Levels and Progression**

**What defines a level in the game?**

- A level consists of a road section with moving vehicles. <span style="color: grey"><s>and a river section with floating logs, turtles, and hazards.</span></s> At the top of the screen are water  slots where the frog must reach.

**What changes between levels?**

- **Traffic Speed and Volume:** Vehicles number increase (up to 16 at the same time on the screen), at the same time as their movement speed.
- <span style="color: grey">**River Difficulty:** The speed of logs/turtles increases, and gaps between safe zones may become larger.</span>

**What happens after the player completes a level?**

- The player proceeds to the next level, which increases in difficulty. The game continues until the player runs out of lives. Reaching the next level does not restore lives.

# Frogger - Team 2

## Introduction to Frogger

Frogger is a classic arcade game originally developed by Konami in 1981. The game's objective is to guide a frog from the bottom of the screen to its home at the top, avoiding various hazards along the way.

### Gameplay Basics

#### Objective

The player controls a frog, navigating it through multiple hazards, such as moving cars, trucks, and logs. The primary goal is to reach the frogâ€™s home at the top of the screen without being hit or falling into the water.

#### Controls

The player uses directional controls (up, down, left, right) to move the frog. The frog can move one step at a time, with each step taking it closer to its destination.

#### Game Mechanics

- **Road Traffic**: Vehicles (cars, trucks) move horizontally across the screen. Colliding with any of them will result in losing a life.
- **River**: The player must hop onto floating logs and turtles to safely cross the river. Falling into the water results in losing a life.
- **Home Spaces**: At the top of the screen are safe spaces where the frog must land to complete the level.

#### Levels and Difficulty

As the player advances through the levels, the speed and difficulty increase. Vehicles move faster, and obstacles become more challenging to navigate.

#### Key Features

- **Time Limit**: Each round has a time limit. If the player does not reach a safe spot before time runs out, they lose a life.

- **Bonus Points**: Points are awarded for each successful frog that reaches its home, and additional points can be earned by collecting bonuses like flies or ferrying frogs across the river.

Frogger is a timeless game that challenges players with its simple controls but complex timing and strategy. Its charm lies in the balance between risk and reward as players attempt to guide the frog to safety while avoiding various dangers.
